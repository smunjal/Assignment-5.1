# Problem

For bar coupon offers, which driver were more likely to accept (use) the coupon. 

    

### Findings

<ul>
    <li>Of the total drivers who were might accept a bar coupon are y 41% of all drivers(Fig 4)</li>
    <li>Of the drivers who might accepts a bar coupon, more than 75% visit a bar 3 times or less than who those drivers who visit that more times(Fig 5)</li>
    <li>75% of drivers those who visit a bar between 1 - 3 times are below the age < 25 yrs(Fig 6 & 7)</li>
    <li>Drivers who accept bar coupon visit the bar are mostly
        <ul><li>Alone</li><li>Friends</li><li>Partners</li></ul>
        Never when a kid in the car
    </li>
    <li>Drivers visit a bar more than once a month are mostly
        <ul><li>Unemployed</li>
        <li>Or hold good jobs like Sales & Related, Management, Computer & Mathematical </li>
        <li>Students also visits bar more than once a month</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Drivers visiting a bar atleast 1 or more time are mostly Students and Married partners only visit a bar < 1 </li>
    <li>Drivers visit the bar between 6-10pm </li>
</ul>

### Analysis
So the target audience drivers who are Alone in the car and below <= 26 yrs, mostly likely on their way back home after 6:00 pm. Single or Married with a Friend who are either unemployed or students are most likely to accept a coupon. Married Partners are other group are more likely to accept a atleast coupon once a month and never when the kid is in the car.  

### Next Steps
The next interesting feature we can look at are <br><ul><li>"gender" </li><li>Direction of Driving</li><li>Weather</li></ul> of those drivers when they visit a bar, whether acceptance of drivers can be increased

Since most drivers are "Unemployed" possibly "income" feature may not be the best criteria for Bar Coupons acceptance. Also based on this data the 'education" feature is something we can ignore becaue 8/10 occupation of drivers shows they are well-educated.
